# Releasing

One rule: the version is the release date. Nothing else stores or maintains a version number, so nothing can drift out of alignment.

## The version scheme (CalVer)

Every release is stamped from the date, in `America/Los_Angeles`:

```
YYYY . (month*100 + day) . (releases already cut that day)
```

| Released on (PT)          | Version           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 2026-07-14, nightly       | `2026.714.0`      |
| 2026-07-14, re-cut by hand| `2026.714.1`      |
| 2026-08-09, nightly       | `2026.809.0`      |
| 2026-12-31, nightly       | `2026.1231.0`     |

Each field is a plain integer, which buys three properties at once:

- It is valid semver. VS Code requires `major.minor.patch` and forbids leading zeros, so `2026.07.14` and the 2-part `20260714.105030` are both rejected. The integer form is not.
- It increases strictly. A later build always sorts higher, across same-day re-cuts, days, months, and years, so the Marketplace and update ordering is always right. The counter resets to `0` only when the day changes, which also changes the minor field. Semver compares minor before patch, so a reset can never order a new release below an old one.
- It needs no bookkeeping. There is no "next version" to decide. The date decides, and the job counts.

The same string is the git tag (`v2026.714.0`), the GitHub Release title, and the version stamped into the `.vsix`. `package.json` stays pinned at `0.0.0` on purpose. It is not a source of truth: the release job overwrites it at build time and never commits the change back.

When the newest tag is from today, the job resumes from that tag's patch field rather than starting at `0`, which is what makes a same-day re-cut land on `.1`. A per-day counter is enough because the cron fires once a night and `concurrency: release` serializes it against a manual dispatch. Tags cut before 2026-07-31 carry a time-of-day patch field instead (`v2026.730.54523`). That changeover was one-way and needed no special case: the resume rule treats an old patch value like any other.

## How a release happens

The `Release` workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs nightly at 04:00 PT. It can also be run by hand: Actions → Release → *Run workflow*.

1. If nothing has landed since the last tag, it stops. No empty releases.
2. It runs `pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`. `vsce package` only runs a build, and the release cron fires on its own schedule whether or not CI for the newest commit has finished, or finished green. The job proves the commit for itself rather than trusting a status lookup that may be pending or absent.
3. It runs the integration suite (`pnpm test:integration`, under xvfb) twice: once against the `engines.vscode` floor read from `package.json`, once against stable. This is the only place the floor is ever launched (the claim is otherwise unverifiable), and the suite includes opening a real-shaped document (invalid mermaid diagram included) in the real custom editor and failing if the webview stops answering after paint. The first run of this step found two floor-only bugs that had shipped in every prior release.
4. It rolls both changelogs (see below), writes end-user highlights, packages the `.vsix`, tags the commit, and publishes a GitHub Release with the `.vsix` attached.
5. Two further jobs, `publish` and `publish-openvsx`, push that same `.vsix` to the VS Code Marketplace and to Open VSX. They run in parallel and fail independently.
6. Finally it commits both rolled changelogs back to `main`.

That is the whole loop, and it is fully automatic. The one thing it writes to `main` is that changelog commit. It is the last step, so it can never fail a release that has already shipped.

### Re-running after a failed publish

Re-run the failed publish job alone. Re-running the whole workflow derives a new version from the clock, so it cuts a new release rather than retrying the failed one. `--skip-duplicate` makes both jobs idempotent, so re-running one after its registry already accepted the version is a no-op rather than a hard failure.

### Why publishing is a separate job, and why there are two of them

Publishing is the only part that needs the `marketplace-publish` environment, and an environment is a policy surface: a required reviewer or a deployment branch rule added to it would stall every job that declares it. Splitting keeps the tag, the GitHub Release, and the downloadable `.vsix` out of reach of a policy only publishing cares about, and means a broken credential costs one skipped job rather than the whole release.

The two registries are then split from each other for the same reason at the next level down. They share nothing but the `.vsix`, and their credentials fail in unrelated ways: an Entra login that stops working must not hold Open VSX back, and a revoked Open VSX token must not hold the Marketplace back. Each is dormant until its own secret exists, so the registries can be turned on one at a time.

Neither job packages anything. Both download the release job's artifact, so all three destinations carry identical bytes and the single build-provenance attestation covers every channel. `shared/__tests__/releaseWorkflow.test.ts` fails if a publish job grows a `package` step, because packaging locally would produce a different archive (see [Verifying a release](#verifying-a-release)) while looking, in a diff, like a harmless simplification.

> DST note: GitHub cron is UTC-only. `0 11 * * *` is 04:00 during PDT and 03:00 during PST. Change it to `0 12 * * *` to anchor 04:00 to standard time.

## The changelog

There are two, split by product. `CHANGELOG.md` is the editor and the extension and ships inside the VSIX, so it is what both registries render. `mac/CHANGELOG.md` is Birta Writer for Mac, and `.vscodeignore`'s `mac/**` keeps it out of the VSIX: the Mac app is installable from neither registry, so its entries would reach a reader who cannot act on them. The release job stamps BOTH with the same version, commits both back, and `scripts/gen-release-notes.mjs` reads both, because a GitHub Release carries the VSIX and the Mac app together. Which file an entry belongs in is decided in AGENTS.md.

Entries are written under `## [Unreleased]` as work lands. The release job runs `scripts/stamp-changelog.mjs`, which renames that heading to the version being cut and opens a fresh empty one, then commits the result to `main`. A stamped heading reads `## [2026.805.0] - 2026, August 5`. No version heading is ever written by hand, and `[Unreleased]` holds only what has not shipped yet.

The heading's date is derived from the CalVer version rather than read from a clock, so the two cannot disagree. A second clock read could land on the other side of midnight from the one that produced the version.

The empty `## [Unreleased]` that the stamp leaves behind is removed from the copy that goes into the VSIX (`scripts/strip-empty-unreleased.mjs`), so the Marketplace Changelog tab opens on the version the reader installed. The repository copy keeps the heading, because the next stamp finds that section by name.

### A release with no user-visible changes still gets a heading

Its body reads `_No user-visible changes; internal work only._`. Commits land that a user cannot observe, and `2026.802.0` was one. Giving it a heading keeps the version sequence gap-free instead of implying the release never happened.

### The tag points at the pre-stamp commit

A tagged tree's `CHANGELOG.md` is therefore one heading behind the artifact built from it. This is the same relationship `package.json` has always had, stamped at build time and never committed back. It is also why the release guard filters its own stamp commits out by subject (`release: stamp ...`) rather than depending on where the tag sits. Change that subject without changing the guard in `release.yml` and the nightly will cut an empty release every night, each one stamping another heading. `shared/__tests__/releaseWorkflow.test.ts` checks the two against each other.

### The pre-Marketplace history lives in its own file

The semver releases up to `0.2.3` were never publicly installable. They live in [`CHANGELOG-PRE-MARKETPLACE.md`](CHANGELOG-PRE-MARKETPLACE.md), which `.vscodeignore` keeps out of the VSIX.

## Release notes

`scripts/gen-release-notes.mjs` reads this version's section of both changelogs, merges them by heading so each Keep a Changelog section appears once, and condenses the result into [cursor.com/changelog](https://cursor.com/changelog)-style notes. Run by hand against an unstamped tree, it falls back to `[Unreleased]`.

It reads the stamped section for a reason. Reading `[Unreleased]` unconditionally is what made four consecutive nightly releases re-announce the entire product, because nothing ever rolled that section and it had accumulated every entry ever written.

Without an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, when a call fails, or when a reply does not hold exactly one line per changelog entry, it re-sections those same changelog entries into the notes taxonomy itself, mechanically, and only drops to a categorized commit list when there is no changelog section to read at all. So a release never blocks on the model, and never publishes less than the changelog already said.

That order matters more than it looks. The commit list used to be the only fallback, and it did not read `CHANGELOG.md` at all: a `Security` entry did not merely land in the wrong section, it never reached the notes, and the commit subject appeared in its place under `Fixes`. It also published what the observability rule excludes (`refactor: internal cleanup` went out under `Other`), and it contradicted the `_No user-visible changes_` marker by listing the commits that marker exists to suppress.

Both paths place an entry the same way, by the `NOTES_SECTIONS` table, and neither can move one. The no-key path renames sections wholesale. The AI path is called once per changelog section and returns one line per entry for the caller to file; a reply holding any other number of lines is refused, because merging, splitting and dropping are indistinguishable after the fact.

That is a change of kind, not of degree. The AI path used to receive the whole release at once and be told the mapping in prose, which is a request rather than a constraint, and `v2026.813.0` is what a request bought: four `Fixed` entries were published under `Improved`, so a reader comparing the release page against the Marketplace changelog found the same release sorted two ways. What the model still decides is the wording of each line, and which entries are lifted into the two promoted headings. What it cannot decide is which section anything is filed under.

It does see two headings, and neither is a placement it could act on. The section's own name goes in as context for the rewrite. A promotion names its destination, because choosing which entries lead is the judgement being delegated: `Highlights` takes 1 to 4 out of `Added`, and `Breaking changes` takes however many of `Removed` a user must act on, which is often none. Those counts are enforced against the reply rather than requested, though only the `Highlights` bound actually constrains anything; how many removals are breaking is the model's call, and it is the one number in the notes nothing structural checks.

A `####` sub-heading inside a section is carried through and never sent to the model, which cannot see which entries a heading spans when each section is condensed alone. Large releases group this way.

`Security` is the exception, and does not go to the model at all. It is written to a standard the rest of the changelog is not, say what an attacker could and could not do and then stop, and the clause saying what was *not* exposed is half of what a reader needs to decide whether to act. Condensing a paragraph to a line is the operation that drops a qualifier, so those entries are published as written. They read longer than the notes around them, which is the emphasis that section should have.

A malformed reply is retried once before the path is abandoned, so a single stray code fence costs a retry rather than the release's condensed notes.

One thing no check can see: whether the line returned for entry three describes entry three. Order is asked for and assumed.

### What goes in

Two questions decide where a change lands. They apply to both the `CHANGELOG.md` file and the generated notes.

1. Can a user observe it? If not, it goes in neither; it lives in git history. A refactor, an invisible performance or maintainability change, tooling, tests and dependency bumps are all out. A performance win a user can *feel*, like a faster launch, is observable and goes in.
2. What kind of observable change is it? The minimal, general set is New (a capability that didn't exist), Improved (an existing one behaves differently or better), and Fixed (a user-visible bug resolved), plus Removed, Deprecated and Security when they occur.

Magnitude and urgency are not extra categories. They are placement. Breaking changes lead and Security follows, because both are read to decide whether to act. The one to four headline new features are lifted into Highlights. Everything else is ordered by significance within its section.

Below all of it, every release body closes with one line linking the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BirtaLabs.birta-writer) and [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/BirtaLabs/birta-writer) listings, followed only by the verification footer the release job appends. A GitHub release page offers the `.vsix` asset and nothing else, which is the worst of the three ways to install and the only one the page shows: it does not update itself, so a reader who takes it has silently opted out of every later release. Naming the registries in the body is what puts the maintained paths in front of that reader at all. The line is appended outside the three body paths, so a failed API call cannot lose it, and `shared/__tests__/releaseNotes.test.ts` checks both links land below the last section.

The two surfaces express the same taxonomy in their own vocabulary:

| Surface | Sections |
|---|---|
| `CHANGELOG.md` (the record) | Keep a Changelog: `Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` / `Removed` / `Deprecated` / `Security`. Flag breaking changes inline; don't add a Highlights section, because the generator lifts those. |
| Generated release notes | `Breaking changes` → `Security` → `Highlights` → `New` → `Improved` → `Fixed` → `Deprecated` → `Removed`, and nothing else. |

Every changelog section maps onto one of those, and the mapping is stated once, as the `NOTES_SECTIONS` table in `scripts/gen-release-notes.mjs`. Both body paths file entries by it, and no prompt restates it. The two headings with no source section are promotions out of one, declared alongside it in `PROMOTIONS`.

| `CHANGELOG.md` | Release notes |
|---|---|
| `Security` | `Security`, published as the changelog wrote it |
| `Added` | `New`, with the 1-4 headline items promoted to `Highlights` |
| `Changed` | `Improved` |
| `Fixed` | `Fixed` |
| `Deprecated` | `Deprecated` |
| `Removed` | `Removed`, unless the user must act, which makes it a `Breaking change` |

`Security` leads because the reader is scanning it to decide whether to act, which is the same reason `Breaking changes` lead. This taxonomy has no separate axis for urgency; placement is the axis. `Highlights` is a promotion out of `New`, not a source section, which is why you should never write one in `CHANGELOG.md` by hand.

`shared/__tests__/releaseNotes.test.ts` holds this to the code. It fails if a Keep a Changelog section loses its route, if a destination or a promotion is built but never printed, if an entry is dropped on the way through, or if a heading appears in our own `CHANGELOG.md` that the notes cannot place. It also runs the AI path end to end against a stub standing in for the API, which is what lets placement be asserted rather than argued: the stub echoes the section each line came from, and the test fails if a line surfaces under any other heading. Before that stub existed, every assertion about the AI path was an assertion about the prompt.

A first release is the special case. With no prior public version, every observable change is *New*: there is nothing to Improve or Fix against yet, which is why the initial `[Unreleased]` reads as one consolidated feature list.

## Secrets

Set these in the repo, under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.

| Secret              | Effect when set                                   | Today            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | AI-written highlights instead of a commit list    | recommended      |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`   | Also publishes to the VS Code Marketplace         | set to publish   |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID`   | Required alongside `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`              | set to publish   |
| `OVSX_PAT`          | Also publishes to Open VSX                        | set to publish   |
| `RELEASE_TOKEN`     | Commits the rolled changelogs back to `main`      | needed to stamp  |
| `LINEAR_API_KEY`    | Raises a blocked release in Linear instead of nowhere | needed to be told |

With neither `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` nor `OVSX_PAT`, a release builds the downloadable `.vsix` and stops. That is the "build it, don't publish yet" phase. The two registry secrets are independent, so either can be added on its own.

`AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_TENANT_ID` are not secrets in the usual sense. They are identifiers, not credentials, and nothing about them expires. They are stored as secrets only to keep the tenant out of public logs.

### When a release fails, and how you find out

A blocked release is silent by construction. The publish jobs are `needs: release`, so a failure in the first job skips the rest: no tag, no GitHub Release, no Marketplace or Open VSX publish, and no Mac app asset. An installed copy then asks for an update and is told it is up to date, truthfully, because the newest release really is the last one that succeeded. Nothing about the product looks broken from the outside, which is the whole problem.

GitHub's own scheduled-workflow-failure email is not enough on its own to carry this, and the two reasons are mechanical rather than a matter of attention: it goes to whoever last touched the cron rather than to the repo owner by definition, and it is an Actions notification, which is the class most recipients filter.

So the `alert` job writes the failure into Linear as an Urgent issue in team `MAR`, and comments on that issue rather than filing a second one on each further night, so its age is how long shipping has been blocked. It needs `LINEAR_API_KEY`. Without the secret it degrades to a run summary and says in that summary that no alert was raised; it never fails the workflow, because the release has already failed and a second failure would only bury the first one's diagnosis.

The alert says a release is blocked. It does not say why, and it deliberately does not guess: read the failing step in the run it links.

### `RELEASE_TOKEN` is a real credential

It is a fine-grained personal access token scoped to this repository alone, `Contents: read and write`, set to No expiration. It exists because `main` requires a pull request from anyone but an admin, and `GITHUB_TOKEN` is not one. Branch protection has `enforce_admins` off, so an admin-owned token pushes directly and no bypass rule is involved. CI cannot open a PR instead: pull requests created with `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not trigger workflows, so the required checks would never run and it could never merge. Without the token the release still stamps the packaged changelog and writes correct notes. Only the commit back to `main` is skipped, and the next night's heading simply spans two days.

Check the first run after adding it. The push step is `continue-on-error`, so a rejected push shows up as a green release with no stamp commit rather than as a failure. Read that step's log the first morning rather than inferring from the release having succeeded. Two things are only proven by that run: that an admin-owned token does bypass both the pull-request requirement and the required status checks (documented behaviour of `enforce_admins: false`, not verified here), and that the rebase-before-push handles a PR landing mid-run. Note also that the stamp commit is a push to `main`, so it triggers a CI run of its own each night. `launch-perf` short-circuits on it, and the rest is the ordinary cost of a docs-only commit.

## Marketplace authentication (one-time setup)

Publishing uses Microsoft Entra ID workload identity federation, so no token is stored anywhere. GitHub mints a short-lived OIDC token for the release job, Azure trades it for an Entra credential, and `vsce publish --azure-credential` presents that. There is nothing to rotate and nothing to leak.

### Why not the flow VS Code's own docs describe

Those docs instruct you to create an Azure DevOps PAT scoped to All accessible organizations, which is exactly what Azure DevOps calls a *global* PAT. Global PATs are decommissioned on 2026-12-01: creation is unblocked until then, and existing tokens stop working after ([Azure DevOps blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/retirement-of-global-personal-access-tokens-in-azure-devops/)). Whether an org-scoped PAT can publish instead is unresolved upstream ([microsoft/vscode#322741](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/322741), open, zero comments, no milestone as of 2026-08-04). So the documented path leads to a credential with a known death date, and the docs still instruct you to pick that scope while carrying the retirement banner on the same page.

### This setup should be temporary

The exit from Azure is being built. `vsce publish --oidc` is trusted publishing in the sense npm and PyPI mean it: the GitHub Actions OIDC token is exchanged directly at the Marketplace's `POST /_apis/gallery/token` for a short-lived credential, with no Azure resource anywhere in the picture and no fallback to a PAT. It merged 2026-07-23 ([microsoft/vscode-vsce#1291](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-vsce/pull/1291)) but ships only on the `next` channel (`3.9.3-3`; `latest` is `3.9.2`), and nothing confirms the Marketplace exposes the trusted-publishing policy it requires. The question asked on that PR on 2026-07-30 is unanswered, and [microsoft/vsmarketplace#1422](https://github.com/microsoft/vsmarketplace/issues/1422) is still open.

When both land the migration is small: drop the `azure/login` step, swap `--azure-credential` for `--oidc`, register the policy once, delete the subscription. `id-token: write` and the `marketplace-publish` environment are already there.

### The setup, once

1. A user-assigned managed identity in the Azure portal, not an App Registration. An App Registration is free and needs no subscription, so it looks like the obvious choice; it reportedly authenticates successfully and then fails the publish itself with `InvalidAccessException: The requested operation is not allowed`. That failure was reported by others and not reproduced here. Microsoft documents this flow for Azure Pipelines only, so the GitHub Actions shape of it is community knowledge, and the one upstream report, [microsoft/vscode-vsce#1023](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-vsce/issues/1023), was closed as not planned with no technical answer, so "unverified" is where it stays.
2. A federated credential on that identity. Scenario *GitHub Actions deploying Azure resources*, entity type Environment, environment name `marketplace-publish`. Branch or Tag bindings match one literal ref and break on the next release, which is why the release job declares this environment.
3. `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_TENANT_ID` copied from the identity's *Properties* into repo secrets.
4. The identity added to the Marketplace publisher as a Contributor. Its Azure object ID will not be found by the publisher's member search. The only id that search accepts comes from querying `https://app.vssps.visualstudio.com/_apis/profile/profiles/me` *as the identity*. A throwaway `workflow_dispatch` workflow did this once, on 2026-07-30, and has since been deleted. If the identity is ever replaced, re-create one to print the new `id`.

This setup is verified by use: the first publish succeeded on 2026-07-31, and every nightly since has published on the same path.

### What the subscription costs, and how it can still lapse

Because the identity lives inside an Azure subscription, the subscription has to stay active or publishing breaks. Everything below was checked against Microsoft's own documentation on 2026-08-04.

#### It is free, and the identity cannot make it otherwise

[Managed identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) "can be used at no extra cost". Cost comes only from services that *use* one. This identity holds no role on any subscription, hence `allow-no-subscriptions: true` in the publish job, so it cannot generate usage even by accident.

The free trial was upgraded to pay-as-you-go on 2026-08-04 with the Basic support plan, which is included at $0. The adjacent option on that screen, Developer, is $29/month and is the only way the upgrade itself costs money. A $1 monthly budget alert in Cost Management is the tripwire for the $0 expectation being wrong; Azure requires a budget above zero, and budgets alert rather than block.

#### Do not verify the upgrade by looking for an offer id

This is a Microsoft Customer Agreement subscription, so its Overview reads `Plan: Azure plan`, the MCA form of pay-as-you-go (MS-AZR-0017G). The legacy `Offer: Pay-As-You-Go (MS-AZR-0003P)` that most write-ups tell you to look for belongs to older MOSA accounts and is not available under MCA at all, so hunting for it reads as a failed upgrade when nothing is wrong. The tell that the upgrade landed is that Upgrade subscription disappears from the subscription's command bar.

#### Disabling is not deletion

A trial that runs out of credit is disabled, not emptied: "if you use resources that aren't free and your subscription gets disabled because you run out of credit, and then you upgrade your subscription, the resources get enabled after upgrade" ([reactivating a disabled subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/subscription-disabled)). A lapse therefore costs downtime, not a repeat of the one-time setup above. The client id stays valid and the publisher's Contributor entry stays good.

#### The clock that remains is inactivity, not billing

A subscription with no usage, activity, or open support requests for 12 months is notified, blocked 30 days later, and deleted 90 days after that, and "any resources in the subscription are also deleted" ([avoiding unused subscriptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/avoid-unused-subscriptions)). This setup is close to the worst case for that test, since the nightly publish produces Entra sign-ins but no ARM usage whatsoever, and whether "activity" covers a sign-in is undocumented. Earliest possible trouble is around 2027-08.

The mechanical defence is to grant the identity Tag Contributor on its resource group and have the nightly write a tag. It is deliberately not implemented: it widens a publish-only identity into a write credential to guard against a hazard the `--oidc` migration above should remove first.

#### A dead identity is loud, not silent

`HAS_AZURE` keys on the secret existing, and the secrets outlive the subscription, so a broken credential *fails* the publish job rather than skipping it, and a failing scheduled workflow notifies. The tag, the GitHub Release, and the downloadable VSIX are unaffected. Only the Marketplace listing stops moving.

#### None of this touches the listing itself

A Marketplace publisher is a Microsoft account plus an Azure DevOps organization, and no subscription appears anywhere in that path. If all of the above were deleted tomorrow, `BirtaLabs.birta-writer` would stay live and installable at its last published version.

## Open VSX (the second registry)

The VS Code Marketplace's terms of use restrict it to Microsoft's own products, so every fork reads a different registry: VSCodium, Cursor, Windsurf, Gitpod and Eclipse Theia all default to [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/), run by the Eclipse Foundation. Publishing there is the only way Birta Writer is installable in any of them, and it is a plain token upload with none of the Azure apparatus above.

The license is not an obstacle. Open VSX requires that an extension declare one, and explicitly permits licenses the OSI does not recognize as open source ([Open VSX FAQ](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/open-vsx-registry-faq/)), so FSL-1.1-ALv2 publishes without a waiver. `LICENSE` ships inside the `.vsix` already.

### The setup, once

1. Sign the Eclipse Foundation Open VSX Publisher Agreement. Log in to [open-vsx.org](https://open-vsx.org/) with GitHub and accept it on your profile page.
2. Generate an access token at [open-vsx.org/user-settings/tokens](https://open-vsx.org/user-settings/tokens). The value is shown once and never again.
3. Create the namespace. It must equal `package.json`'s `publisher` field exactly, which is `BirtaLabs`:

   ```bash
   npx ovsx create-namespace BirtaLabs -p <token>
   ```

4. Store the token as the `OVSX_PAT` repository secret, under Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions. From the next release on, `publish-openvsx` runs.

All four steps were completed on 2026-08-11 and the [listing](https://open-vsx.org/extension/BirtaLabs/birta-writer) is live, so this section matters again only for a token rotation (below) or a new namespace.

Creating the namespace makes you a contributor of it, which is already exclusive: since 2020-12-17 only members of a namespace may publish into it, so nobody else can push a `BirtaLabs.*` extension ([Namespace Access](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/wiki/Namespace-Access)). Note that `ovsx`'s own README still describes the pre-2020 behavior, where a new namespace was open to everyone; the wiki is the authority.

What a contributor does not have is an owner. A namespace with no owner is unverified, and every extension in it renders with a warning icon and a banner instead of the verified shield, however trustworthy the publisher. Claiming ownership fixes that and lets you manage members. Open an issue at [EclipseFdn/open-vsx.org](https://github.com/EclipseFdn/open-vsx.org/issues/new/choose) while logged in to open-vsx.org. Granting is deliberately public, so a claim can be disputed in the thread. Worth doing, and not a prerequisite for publishing.

### The first minutes after a publish are meant to look wrong

A version appears as `Deactivated`, and absent from search and the extension page, immediately after upload. Processing is asynchronous; the version activates when it completes, usually within seconds. Something that stays deactivated for minutes is a failed processing run rather than a slow one, and is worth chasing. Its icon is extracted during the same pass, so a placeholder tile before activation means nothing either way. This is observed behavior from this extension's first publish, not something the registry documents, so if a later publish behaves differently, trust what you see over this paragraph.

### The first publish

Nothing has to wait for a nightly. Publish the artifact from the newest GitHub Release, which is the same file the Marketplace holds and the one the attestation covers:

```bash
gh release download --repo harlanlewis/birta-writer --pattern '*.vsix'
npx ovsx publish --packagePath birta-writer-*.vsix -p <token>
```

Publishing by hand and letting the nightly publish cannot collide: the version is derived from the release date, so a hand-published version is one the nightly will never re-cut, and `--skip-duplicate` covers a re-run of the same one anyway.

### `OVSX_PAT` is a real credential, and it is the only signal

Unlike `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, which are identifiers that never expire, this is a bearer token that can be revoked or deleted from the account page. There is nothing else to notice that: the job authenticates and uploads in one step, so a dead token surfaces as a failed `publish-openvsx`, which is a failing scheduled workflow and does notify. The Marketplace, the tag, the GitHub Release and the downloadable `.vsix` are all unaffected. Only the Open VSX listing stops moving.

Rotating is generating a new token, replacing the secret, and revoking the old one. The namespace and the published versions are unaffected either way.

## Verifying a release

A source audit tells you what the *source* does. It cannot tell you that the published binary was built from that source. Every release closes that gap with a [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)-backed build-provenance attestation, binding the VSIX's digest to this repository, the exact commit, and the workflow run that produced it:

```
gh attestation verify birta-writer-<version>.vsix --repo harlanlewis/birta-writer
```

The Marketplace upload, the Open VSX upload and the GitHub Release asset are the same file. The release job packages once and both publish jobs upload that artifact rather than rebuilding, so one attestation covers all three channels. A `SHA256SUMS.txt` is attached alongside for anyone who just wants to compare two files.

### What is not yet true: byte-reproducibility

You cannot currently rebuild a tag and get a byte-identical VSIX. The published hash is therefore an identifier for that artifact, not something a third party can independently derive.

Measured 2026-07-30: two `pnpm run package` runs from an identical tree produced different archive hashes, with identical extracted contents and identical entry order. The only difference was the zip entry mtimes: `...173236` in one, `...173240` in the other.

That locates the problem precisely. The *build* is already deterministic; the *container* is not, because `vsce package` stamps each zip entry with the wall clock and exposes no `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`-style override. Closing it means normalizing timestamps in the archive after `vsce` writes it, which is real work and is tracked in MAR-130. Don't claim reproducibility until that lands. Until then, provenance answers "did this pipeline build it from that commit", which is the question most people actually have, but not "can I derive these bytes myself".

## Channels, later

There is one channel today. If a pre-release ("insiders") stream is ever wanted, it is a flag, not a number: add `--pre-release` to the Marketplace publish step for those builds. The CalVer scheme is unchanged, because the date and counter keep stable and pre-release builds correctly ordered on their own, and VS Code routes users by the flag. Do not encode the channel into the version.
