///
/// Two facts a row needs and neither of which is the other. A row can be
/// operable and still be reporting a problem (login registered and waiting on
/// the user), and a row can be inoperable for a reason that is nobody's fault
/// (a development build cannot replace itself). Collapsing them into one flag
/// is what leaves a dead switch with a grey sentence under it that reads like a
/// description of the setting.
///
/// So: `isEnabled` decides whether the controls take a click and whether the
/// LABEL is drawn dimmed, and `tone` decides the colour of the sentence. The
/// surfaces apply that pairing in one place each, which is what keeps a row
/// added later from inventing a third way to look unavailable.
///
/// Here rather than in the window because every rule below is decidable from
/// values: what a development build cannot do, and what macOS reported about a
/// login registration. `RowAvailabilityTests` holds them, and the AppKit half
/// (a dimmed label, a red caption) is read back off a live row by
/// `SettingsRowViewTests`.
