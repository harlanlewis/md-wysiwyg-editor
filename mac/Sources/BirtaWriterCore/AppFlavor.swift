/// middle of using, and the old handoff did exactly that: the only way to look
/// at a change was to overwrite the copy holding your notes.
///
/// Four things have to be separate or the two copies fight, and every one of
/// them has actually got apps into trouble:
///
///   - the bundle id, because it names the defaults domain, so without it the
///     two share a hotkey setting, a note location and an agent command,
///   - the note itself, because two apps autosaving one file is two writers
///     racing over somebody's writing,
///   - the hotkey, because a global one is first come first served: the second
///     app to launch simply fails to register and is reachable only from the
///     menu bar,
///   - self-update, because a development build that replaced itself with the
///     newest release would delete the thing under review.
///
/// Read from the bundle id at runtime rather than set by a compile flag. The
/// id is what macOS keys the defaults domain on, so deriving everything else
/// from it means the flavour and the domain cannot disagree; a flag can.
