/// instead of the editor rather than in a window of its own.
///
/// In the panel because a first launch has nothing to edit yet. A separate
/// window puts a form in front of a document the person has not seen, leaves
/// two windows to deal with, and makes the editor available underneath while
/// the settings that decide where its bytes go are still unanswered. Taking the
/// panel over answers all three: there is one window, it is the window they
/// summoned, and there is nothing to type into until the questions are done.
///
/// Every row is a LIVE setting, written the moment it moves, which is why there
/// is no Cancel: there would be nothing to roll back. `Continue` and
/// `All Settings` both simply resolve the screen; neither commits anything the
/// switches have not already committed.
///
/// The defaults the switches show are written when this view first appears
/// (`Prefs.applyOnboardingDefaults`), so what is displayed and what is stored
/// are the same thing from the first frame. That is what lets a default like
/// rich link previews be ON here without ever being ON for somebody who was
/// not shown the switch.
///
/// It composes `SettingsWindowController`'s row, group and caption pieces, so
/// a row that exists in both places is the same row, drawn the same way and
/// worded the same. It is a SUBSET of what Settings shows: the questions
/// somebody cannot answer later without going looking, which is how to summon
/// it, where the notes go, and whether it is an app in the Dock. Everything
/// else has a default worth keeping and a row in Settings, and a screen that
/// listed all of them would be a form rather than a welcome.
