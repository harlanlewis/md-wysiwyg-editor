/// A `Coordinator` is a window: a panel, a WKWebView, a writer, a title and one
/// bound file. It was also, for as long as there was exactly one of them, the
/// place four process-wide registrations happened to live. That is invisible
/// while there is one instance and wrong the moment there are two, in a
/// different way each time:
///
/// * `GlobalHotkey` installs a handler on the process-wide Carbon event
///   dispatcher and registers a FIXED `EventHotKeyID`. A second instance
///   installs a second handler, so one press runs both, and its exclusive
///   registration can come back `eventHotKeyExistsErr`, which the app would
///   report as "another app may own it": misdiagnosing itself.
/// * The measurement signals are one `SIGUSR1` and one `SIGURG` per process,
///   and the message file they read is one fixed path. N handlers would run
///   every probe N times, against one file, which does not make the harness
///   noisy so much as unable to say which window it measured.
/// * `NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents` is app-wide, so N monitors run on
///   every keystroke in the app. The double-Escape guard would still act only
///   for the key window, so this is a cost rather than a bug, until windows
///   start closing: nothing removes the monitor, so each closed window leaves
///   one behind for the life of the process.
/// * `previousApp` is a fact about the APP, not a window. It is captured only
///   when the frontmost application is not us, so a second window summoned
///   while the app is already frontmost captures nothing, and dismissing that
///   window would fall through to `NSApp.hide` and take the other windows with
///   it.
///
/// So they live here, once. What stays in `Coordinator` is everything that is
/// genuinely about one window, which is nearly all of it.
///
/// ## Summon shows and hides the whole set
///
/// Decided rather than inherited: the hotkey brings up every window and
/// dismisses every window, as one workspace. That is why the overlay manners
/// stay on all of them, and it is also what keeps this file simple, because
/// the alternative (summon the most recent) makes `NSApp.hide` and the
/// return-to-previous-app step a per-window arbitration with no good answer.
