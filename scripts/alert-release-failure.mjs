/**
 * Raise a blocked release where the maintainer will actually see it.
 *
 * The Release workflow is the only nightly whose failure stops shipping, and
 * until this script existed it was the only one with no failure handler at all.
 * Its two siblings (perf-nightly, nightly-fidelity) write a run summary and rely
 * on GitHub emailing the maintainer when a scheduled workflow fails. That email
 * goes to whoever last touched the cron rather than to the repo owner by
 * definition, and it is an Actions notification, which is the class people
 * filter away. Three nights of blocked releases went unnoticed that way on
 * 2026-09-10 through 2026-09-12.
 *
 * So this writes to the tracker instead, which is where AGENTS.md says tracked
 * work lives and where the maintainer already looks. It is deliberately NOT a
 * GitHub issue: `nightly-fidelity.yml` explicitly refuses to open one, and an
 * alert is not a reason to break that rule.
 *
 * It DEDUPES. A release stays blocked until someone fixes it, so a nightly that
 * files a fresh Urgent issue every night would bury the one that matters under
 * its own repetitions. An open issue carrying the marker gets a comment; only
 * the absence of one creates anything.
 *
 * It never fails the workflow. The workflow has already failed by the time this
 * runs, and a broken alert reporting a second failure tells the reader nothing
 * about the release. Every exit path here is 0, and every one of them writes
 * what happened into the run summary, including "I could not reach Linear",
 * because an alerting path that can fail silently is the thing this file exists
 * to stop being true.
